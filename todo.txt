=======================
TO DO LIST FOR CATALIST
=======================

agenda Jan 14:
* fix some ui issues [long lists hit bottom of page, the list seems a bit too small]
* make UI responsive? as in it should still look nice with a smaller window, different device, diff browser, etc.
* [in progress] fully flesh out "My Lists"
    - human friendly relative timing?

* start working on permissions
* invite system for lists?
* add an "about" page ... ?
* add a "contact us" page so people can report bugs and stuff
* database cleaning: lists that aren't used for a while should be removed; similar for users (how to handle references to deleted users?)
* figure out hosting
* debug!
* implement this? http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/apierrors/
* implement email notification of errors
    - see http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/errorhandling/#error-mails

[I think this is done -txz] Properly format all the responses from server, on client side
Get name of user instead of inserted_id
That gray still bothers me: will eventually find an alternative
Test out loadlist and related

DESIGN
* * * * *

Should we make .list a uniform, grayish color? (use a color picker to figure out the hex value of a nice part of the div)
