=======================
TO DO LIST FOR CATALIST
=======================

agenda Jan 14:
* fix some ui issues [long lists hit bottom of page, ]
* fully flesh out "My Lists"
* start working on permissions
* invite system for lists?
* add an "about" page ... ?
* add a "contact us" page so people can report bugs and stuff
* database cleaning: lists that aren't used for a while should be removed; similar for users (how to handle references to deleted users?)
* figure out hosting
* debug!

Properly format all the responses from server, on client side
Get name of user instead of inserted_id
That gray still bothers me: will eventually find an alternative
Test out loadlist and related

DESIGN
* * * * *

Should we make .list a uniform, grayish color? (use a color picker to figure out the hex value of a nice part of the div)
