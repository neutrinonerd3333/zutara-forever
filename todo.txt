=======================
TO DO LIST FOR CATALIST
=======================

011216
Properly format all the responses from server, on client side
Get name of user instead of inserted_id
That gray still bothers me: will eventually find an alternative
Test out loadlist and related

DESIGN
* * * * *

Links on top right (MIT 6.148 | Login ...) seem a bit big (I've heard the saying that smaller text is more classy)
On login/register page, helpful text that pops up on $("input").focus() seems a bit big too
Along the same line, the <input>'s seem awkwardly small relative to the help text
    maybe widen the <input>'s and shrink the help text?
Black text on the light colored background is a bit *too* contrasty
Should we make .list a uniform, grayish color? (use a color picker to figure out the hex value of a nice part of the div)
Perhaps make our own logo for Catalist, instead of using text? (It can still be text-based, but not explicit text --
    you know how a lot of places tell you that their logo, even if text based, should not be used as text, but rather
    as images?)
