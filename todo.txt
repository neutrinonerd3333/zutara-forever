=======================
TO DO LIST FOR CATALIST
=======================

agenda Jan 17:
* fix some ui issues [long lists hit bottom of page, the list seems a bit too small]
* make UI responsive? as in it should still look nice with a smaller window, different device, diff browser, etc.
* [in progress] fully flesh out "My Lists"
    - human friendly relative timing?

* permissions UI
* invite system for lists?
* database cleaning: lists that aren't used for a while should be removed; similar for users (how to handle references to deleted users?)
* debug!
* implement email notification of errors
