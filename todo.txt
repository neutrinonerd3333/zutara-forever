=======================
TO DO LIST FOR CATALIST
=======================

agenda Jan 17:
* make UI responsive? as in it should still look nice with a smaller window, different device, diff browser, etc.
* [in progress] fully flesh out "My Lists"
    - human friendly relative timing?

* permissions UI
* invite system for lists?
* database cleaning: lists that aren't used for a while should be removed; similar for users (how to handle references to deleted users?)
* make users activate account?
* password recovery
* debug!
* implement email notification of errors
    - see http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/errorhandling/#error-mails
* resolve concurrency issues (should we make list editing a mutex operation? how to prevent deadlock?)
