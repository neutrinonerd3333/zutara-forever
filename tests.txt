====================
 THINGS TO TEST FOR
====================

HTML ESCAPING -- unsafe (read: user-provided) variables should escaped.
    To find things that might need escaping, try "grep -r . {{" in templates directory
    See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#html-escaping
 
NON-ASCII INPUTS -- exactly what it sounds like. Things to test, from easy to hard:
    letters
    alphanumeric
    extended Latin (e.g. é, ü, í, ñ, ã, ç, ø, ß, œ, æ)
    Cyrillic
    Chinese, Japanese, Korean [to check utf-8]
    Arabic, Hebrew (go crazy with right-to-left!)
    spaces
    nonprinting characters? (\000, \001, ..., \031)
    ... drag some images into the input? arbitrary files?
    ... especially login stuff (restrict usernames to [a-z][A-Z][0-9].-_
     
VARIED INPUT LENGTHS
    zero length
    super length
    
HTTP ERRORS -- should handle the following:
    404 NOT FOUND   you should know this :P
    403 FORBIDDEN   user not permitted to access
    410 GONE        page has been deleted
    500 SERVER ERR  backend bugs and stuff
