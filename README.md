# Catalist

A web app for making lists. Like, really nice lists.
To use, first make sure `mongod` is running in another shell (or in the background). Then, run `python routes.py`.

Catalist is built with Flask and relies on MongoDB for data persistence.

## Requirements
* A modern browser that supports JQuery 2 (in particular, IE 6/7/8 are not supported)

## Acknowledgements
* API error exception class taken from the [Flask docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/apierrors/)
* Safety Pig brought to us by [Quora](http://qr.ae/RgLMU8)
